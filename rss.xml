But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
